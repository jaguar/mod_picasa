Picasa Webalbum
v0.3 beta
2010-10-14

This is a implementation of Picasa Webalbum into phpwcms as a contentpart with the flexibility of internal images < div > CP and google as content provider.

It uses basically a class by David Gilbert ( http://solidgone.org/Lightweight-php-picasa-api ) to pull a Picasa Webalbum via API, cache the xml and parse it.
Features
phpwcms Backend (Verwaltung) - local.playground.marcus-obst.jpg

Screenshot

    retrieve content from any Picasa Webalbum which is public or shared with an authkey.
    get caption and description from the webalbum
    use nearly the same logic like phpwcms internal images < div > contentpart and you can use the same templates so integrate it seamless.
    adjustable picture size, square cropped images, selection of images from album,sorting
    extendable to render nearly every available data from webalbum (exif, location etc)

ToDo

    Testing, debugging
    custom sorting in backend
    improvements
